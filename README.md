# OverTheWire Krypton
This is a collection of scripts I've written to complete the [Krypton OverTheWire Wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/). This is solely meant for showing off how I did, if you are a student ***DO NOT*** copy this code, please figure it how to do it yourself so you can learn.

## Script Files
Every file is named for the server that you should be running the script on to get the next password, for levels below 10 a leading 0 has been added for better sorting. EX:
_00.sh_ gets the password for Level 1
_23.sh_ gets the password for Level 24

## Multiple answers
Some of the levels have multiple different ways to get the password, if they do it will be listed inside of the same file but will delimit where one solution ends and the next starts.
